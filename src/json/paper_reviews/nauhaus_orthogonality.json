    "summary": [
      "Orientation and spatial frequency maps are consistent across cortical depth in macaque V1",
      "At both microscopic (200x200 microns) and mesoscopic (800x800 microns) scales, orientation and spatial frequency maps are clustered and run orthogonal to each other",
      "Orientation and spatial frequency maps are surprisingly smooth at the scale of a few tens of microns, suggesting that smoothness in intrinsic imaging maps is not solely an artifact of blur"
    ],
    "background": [
      "Maps of spatial frequency tuning have been in rare in macaque and rarely give complete picture due to methodological limitations (resolution and/or sparsity of sampling)",
      "While interactions between orientation and spatial frequency maps have been reported in cats and ferrets, direct evidence in macaques has been elusive"

    "approach": [
      "2P Ca2+ imaging of layer 2/3 macaque V1 neurons at two spatial scales and two depths",
      "Compute tuning curves for each pixel in the large scale map and each neuron in the fine-scale map",
      "Compare tuning for orientations and spatial frequency"
    ],
    "results": [
      "Both orientation and spatial frequency maps are clustered (tuning curves more correlated at closer distances), although spatial frequency maps have more scatter (Figure 4)",
      "Large scale (smooth) maps for orientation and spatial frequency intersect each other at 90-degree angles (Figure 5)",
      "Maps are periodic (2D autocorrelations begin to rise again after about 500 microns (Figure 5)",
      "At fine scale, direction of maximum tuning curve change is orthogonal for orientation and spatial frequency maps (Figure 6)",
      "For a pair of cells, the correlation between tuning curves for orientations is anti-correlated with correlation between tuning curves for spatial frequencies at larger distances"
    ],
    "conclusions": [
      "Maps for both parameters are relatively continuous and have lawful relationships to one another",
      "This is the first study to examine both maps with sufficiently high spatial resolution and density of sampling",
      "Fine-scale maps reveal very smoooth progression of peak tuning curve values"

      "Would be interesting to see color tuning in these imaging regions!"
