    "summary": [
      "Purpose of pinwheels in orientation tuning maps is unknown -- which cost function (task-based, physiological, etc) do they help minimize?"
    ],
    "background": [
      "Self-organizing map models, e.g., Durbin and Mitchison, suggest that pinwheels are a developmental irregularity that occurs if what you're _actually_ trying to do is end up with an Icecube-like structure (repeating bands), see Wolf and Geisel 1998",
      "60% of cortical volume is axons and dendrites (Brait- enberg and Sch√ºz, 1998), so minimizing neurite length is important for keeping brains small",
      "Most inputs to cortical cells are cortical as opposed to thalamic, so minimizing intracortical wiring length was likely selected for over evolutionary time"
    ],
    "approach": [
      "Model orientation tuning maps by minimizing wiring-cost functions of different forms. Specifically, compute wiring-length after deciding on a neuron-connection function (which neurons connect with which other neurons, given their orientation preference?)",
      "Test which functions give maps consistent with biological findings"
    ],
    "results": [
      "If each neuron connects to an equal number of neurons of all preferred orientations, i.e., connection does not depend on orientation preference, the optimal layout is a salt and pepper pattern as observed in rats (Figure 2a-b)",
      "A wide Gaussian connection function, i.e., generally connected to neurons of like orientations, yields the Icecube layout (Figure 2c-d)",
      "A narrow Gaussian function yields pinwheel-like structures, as neurons need to connect both to like-orientation neurons and cross-orientation neurons (Figure 3)",
      "Periodicity of icecube and pinwheel maps depends on the number of connections each neuron is thought to make-- more connections means a higher frequency pattern",
      "Wire-length minimization applied to direction-preference maps are consistent with empirical findings, suggesting it may apply in that context as well (Figure 5)",
      "Irregularities in maps in other animals can be attributed, in part, to incomplete development due to biological noise, blood vessels, anchoring to other maps, etc, see Figure 6."
    ],
    "conclusions": [
      "Emergence of pinwheels can be explained by a simple wiring-cost minimization paradigm. This same rule can explain the emergence of linear zones (as on the V1/V2 boundary) if one assumes a different connection function for those neurons -- this seems reasonable to me",
      "Lack of structure, as in rat, may also be due to a different connection function for V1 neurons",
      "Coupling with other maps is likely weak, given that the same orientation map is seen in many species, including those without maps like ocular dominance (EM: but lots of evidence for alignment between maps nonetheless)",
      "Continuity-based approaches like self-organizing maps are implicitly enforcing a wiring-cost minimization"
    ],
    "other": [
      "Koulakov and Chklovskii write 'we postpone the treatment of the interaction between different cortical maps until more experimental evidence is available.' -- is there sufficient evidence now?",
      "The authors find these maps by updating one neuron's orientation preference, recomputing connections, then recomputing wiring, which can be really slow-- they write that it takes almost 20 days to optimize a grid of 3600 neurons!"
