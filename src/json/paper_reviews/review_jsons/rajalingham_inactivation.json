    "summary": [
      "Inactivation of small regions of IT negatively affects some object discrimination subtasks, but not others",
      "Nearby injections yield similar patterns of behavioral deficits",
      "Decoding models suggest that local discriminability, not local selectivity, are best predictive of the behavioral effects of inactivation"
    ],
    "background": [
      "A large body of work supports the idea that activity in IT is correlated with behavior. However, in the visual motion literature, recent evidence has suggested that regions with behavior-correlated activity are not necessary to support that behavior, i.e., it is epiphenomenal",
      "Previous attempts at causal manipulations have overwhelming been targeted to face patches and to face-specific tasks"
    ],
    "approach": [
      "Inactivate many regions along the ventral surface of IT with muscimol injections (about 2.5mm spread), evaluate effects on object recognition performance on a set of 6 (or 10, in one experiment) subtasks, where each subtask is a pairwise discrimination such as dog vs. elephant",
      "Collect neuron responses in the same regions that are inactivated during a passive fixation task, then compare decoders that predict how neuronal activity translates to behavioral deficits during inactivation"
    ],
    "results": [
      "Inactivation results are hetereogeneous: inactivation of any given site only affects some subtasks (Figures 2, 4), but no task is affected more than others when averaging across all subtasks (Figure 5)",
      "The strongest effect of inactivation is seen when the object of interest is in the visual field contralateral to the injection site and peaks around a d' difference of 0.6 (Figure 3)",
      "Inactivation of nearby sites yields similar behavioral deficits (Figures 6, 7), with correlations that drop to 0 after about 10mm",
      "Models that predict inactivation from response selectivity perform worse than models that predict inactivation from the accuracy of an SVM trained on responses of those neurons (Figure 8)"
    ],
    "conclusions": [
      "IT is necessary for object discrimination behavior, and different regions support different subtasks. It is not the case that all non-face regions are necessary for all non-face tasks",
      "Local discriminability is a strong predictor of the effects of inactivation, suggesting one possible readout mechanism from IT to downstream regions"
    ],
    "other": [
      "See last week's paper-a-week (Afraz et al., 2015) for more inactivation work from the DiCarlo lab, but targeted specifically to face patches",
      "These effects are small in terms of balanced accuracy, and the monkeys are generally at ceiling on these tasks to begin with. There's a very fair and careful justification of using d' instead of accuracy/choice bias/other, and in general the work is incredible carefully done and impressive"
