    "summary": [
      "Neurons in orientation pinwheels are more broadly tuned to orientations and do not saturate as quickly with increasing contrast",
      "Neurons in pinwheels are not as strongly suppressed by cross-orientation plaid gratings",
      "Normalizing responses by local divisive normalization cannot account for empirical results, but normalizing by response of local interneurons can",
      "Argues for functional implications of having pinwheels: having neurons be broadly tuned without suppression saturation is useful for recognizing textures composed of multiple orientations"
    ],
    "background": [
      "Pinwheels in orientation-tuning maps are common in many animals but lacking in others. There is no consensus on whether there is functional utility to having orientation maps",
      "Neurons in pinwheel centers are generally less orientation-selective, which may help with processing stimuli composed of many orientations. But! V1 neurons generally exhibit cross-orientation suppression, which would greatly weaken those responses."
    ],
    "approach": [
      "Record from cat V1 using horizontal linear track electrodes separated by 100 microns.",
      "Evaluate neuronal response characteristics for cells in iso-orientation domains and pinwheel centers.",
      "Develop an image-computable model of V1 neurons that can explain the empirical data"
    ],
    "results": [
      "Neurons in iso-orientation domains are strongly orientation selective (Figure 1a), exhibit strong response saturation (Figure 1c; 1g), and have strong cross-orientation suppression (Figures 1-3)",
      "Model of thalamocortical projections and cortical normalization can reproduce empirical results if an excitation-normalization (EN) model (normalization by non-oriented nearby neurons) is used (Figure 4). The model predicts responses in an experiment with novel stimuli and 3 new subjects (cats), Figure 5)",
      "Divisive normalization would yield results opposite the empirical findings unless unbiological assumptions are made re: the origin of inhibitory projections (Figure 6)",
      "Using a horizontal linear track to record (as opposed to a 2D method) leads to similar conclusions re: whether you're in a pinhweel or iso-orientation domain"
    ],
    "conclusions": [
      "Neurons in pinwheels respond differently to inputs and experience different normalization from surround cells. This allows them to represent multi-orientation patterns without suffering from suppression and saturation",
      "Animals without pinwheels (or any orientation map) may sacrifice pattern recognition for robust edge detection",
      "Local divisive normalization does not account for the empirical results, as it would have the effect of broadening tuning curves in iso-orientation domains and narrowing them at pinwheel centers."
